# HomeSecurity

Objectives :
    Even just a decade ago few people could have predicted the impact the Internet of Things (IoT) would have on our lives. Networks of ‘smart’ internet-connected sensors and embedded computers exchanging information with each other may not sound particularly exciting to those outside the technology industry. But the use cases are virtually limitless. From on-board aircraft guidance systems to driverless vehicles, and life-saving smart drug infusion pumps to smart city public safety systems, the IoT is everywhere. And it’s making our lives better in the process. It has the power to make us happier, more productive, safer and even more healthy citizens. And from a corporate perspective it’s even more developed – helping to make businesses more agile, while cutting costs and driving performance improvements and efficiencies
The smart home isn’t coming, it’s already here. And device adoption in certain cases has reached a tipping point
The smart home is woefully insecure due to users’ failure to follow best practices
Consumers prefer security to usability, and they’re prepared to take more responsibility if it means living in a safer home.
